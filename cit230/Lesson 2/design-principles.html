    <center><p class="paragraph"> Pinterest uses alignment in a very interesting way compared to other sites. Notice how on Pinterest, not all of the photos are the same size, but they still look very neat and aligned. Pinterest does a great job of this by making uniform padding and margins for everything on the site, so even though not everything is the same exact size, it is still aligned.</p></center>

As you can see, they use one photo to catch your attention, while keeping the site clean and simple looking, and allowing the white space to guide the user without stressing out their experience.</p></center>

    <center><p class="paragraph">The Wellington Zoo website does a fantastic job of using Contrasting colors, while keeping their site very nice and easy to look at. How do they do this? The site is using bright contrasting colors throughout, while subtly matching colors throughout the page. Notice how the orange background is the same color as the Donate button on the top right?</p></center>
